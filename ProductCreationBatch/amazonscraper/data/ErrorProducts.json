                "\n  LG has offered Standard Installation @ ₹999 . But charged 1299. They are saying that Rs300 for installing the L shape wall mount bracket for outdoor unit. I expected that this will  be covered as part of standard installation. we also need  to purchase additional wall mount bracket (L shape clamp) for installing out door unit . LG/AC company should provide complete accessories as normally outdoor unit required support for installing the same . They are providing the clamps for installing the indoor unit. For TV , technician  will provide wall mount bracket free of cost and free installation . we have have to  purchase AC plus wall mount bracket for outdoor unit. There are additional charges for standard installation and charges for fixing of wall mount bracket. It is making complication for customer. and giving opportunity to make lot of money who is installing the AC unit\n",

                "3 Engineers visited my place and all of them said the same thing \"Sir, AC technically ok hai\" means panel temperature and Gas and current was ok...I have all screen capture with me and also the video where service engineer is convincing me to log a case with LG as this KS series is worst.",
                "Lol Worst part is they have an option to see the Room Temp on remote itself and I am running AC on HC ( high Cooling - 16 Degree Cent ) and room temp is not going below 24 even though we ran it for 1-2 hr.",
                "Place like pune where temp doesn't go more than 40 and if this AC isn't working there then I can think of the tropical place and North India.",

                "\n  Amazing machine..saw some reviews...wonder how people can be so dumb to set the room temp to 16 and expect it to cool to 16 degrees...machine is one of the best value for money machine.\n",
                "\n  Don't ever buy this AC.It stopped working before 1 year of buying itself.The service from LG is the worst and they are not even ready to cover it under warranty.Worst service!! Don't waste your money go for any other brands.\n",
                "\n  Return amount not credited to account\n"

                "\n  LG has offered Standard Installation @ ₹999 . But charged 1299. They are saying that Rs300 for installing the L shape wall mount bracket for outdoor unit. I expected that this will  be covered as part of standard installation. we also need  to purchase additional wall mount bracket (L shape clamp) for installing out door unit . LG/AC company should provide complete accessories as normally outdoor unit required support for installing the same . They are providing the clamps for installing the indoor unit. For TV , technician  will provide wall mount bracket free of cost and free installation . we have have to  purchase AC plus wall mount bracket for outdoor unit. There are additional charges for standard installation and charges for fixing of wall mount bracket. It is making complication for customer. and giving opportunity to make lot of money who is installing the AC unit\n",
