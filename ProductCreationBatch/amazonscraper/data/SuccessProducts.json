It is making horrible noise during spin function, you literally have to rush and hold the machine as it's moving so horribly. Please don't buy Samsung products because they don't even bother to solve your issues after calling customer service so many times. The person came and test the machine with 4 clothes even after having 6.5 kg capacity. Then machine did not make noise at that time and they updated the issue as resolved and again same story the other day. Really frustrated with this machine and Samsung service. I have uploaded a video of the spin function making that noise. For reference.\n",

                "\n  Received damaged product. Could not close door of the fridge. Secondly product was not level. One area had a bigger knob causing product to tilt on one side. Worst part is we exchanged our old fridge for this.  So we are stuck with a defective product and all our food has perished.  Poor support.\n",
                "\n  Installation person informed that we need to buy a V Gaurd Stablizer which costs around 2600/- extra now because the existing stablizer will not work for this Refrigerator. Why this was not mentioned or highlighted while purchasing this? Now we need to spend another 2600/- for this.",

                "\n  Let me warn the potential customers from buying Haier refrigerator as the company uses cheap quality paint which starts chipping off and rusting after 1 year of use and though I took extended warranty from Amazon but the warranty service provider Acko refused saying that they do not cover it so check with Amazon. Amazon customer care had a different story to tell as she informed me that for the extended warranty the order ID was never generated at the time of my purchase so Amazon can't help while Acko did issue me a warranty document and they do have my warranty details",
                "Also the brand Haier simply shrug off the responsibility by saying that they cannot help it since the brand warranty period of 1 year is over",
                "I must say that Haier as well as Amazon cheated on me and I definitely would suggest not to go in for such poor quality products of Haier. Also do not get into the trap of Amazon as it charges for extended warranty and some third party service provider will never service the product.",

                "I called up the engineer he came twice, checked and tried to fix it but still no ice. Then I registered a new complaint and now I'm waiting for the engineer to come back again.",

Amazon kept its promise and delivered within the time and bought it at 18999 and 1000 extra Amazon payback. Haier personnel was at my doorstep within an hour or two after delivery and installed and gave tutorial very gently. Thanks Haier for such beautiful Product and services and thanks Amazon for such beautiful services and great discount. Amazon for a reason, by default reason. Thank you\n",

                "\n  I gave 2 star not for the product. The product is superb it takes less electricity, worth buying. The two star os only for Amazon service. It is the worst customer service and delivery service I have met. It was open box verification so delivery guy kept fridge in hall and took photo. Once photo is taken the moves the fridge from hall to kitchen at that time the delivery guy broke the fridge.when I spoke with Amazon customer service they are not responding good and the delivery guy is too harsh. Really worst service from amazon.if you want buy small items from amazon and large appliances go directly to showroom and get it..\n",

Amazon and Whirlpool both together fooled me and doing the same with other customers. This is a plain refrigerator fridge section works as fridge and freezer section works as freezer its not convertible from Freezer to fridge and Fridge to freezer. This feature is not available but the company is promoting the product as Convertible. Please dont become pray and waste money on this  Whirlpool fridge instead try other brands which really gives you this feature.

Ice also started to be in the entire freezer time waste money wast dont by this product\n",
                "\n  Ice forms and melts and then ices up again at the bottom of the freezer, seems there is not an efficient way for the water to escape, defrosted the refrigerator by turning it off there was a pool of water on the floor of the freezer, had to soak it up with a towel to get rid of it.  The technician who installed the refrigerator set up the freezer settings told me that was optimum with intellisense, then later filed a complaint and had a technician come who set the freezer to a different mode, said everything would be fine.  Not good still the same problem.  Frost free technology has been around for the last forty years, whirlpool has been in this business for ages, yet this product stinks, had a single door whirlpool before this still have it a single door not frost free, still works after 18 years.  Very disappointed with this product, stay away from it.\n"

Amazon sent their technician and these Amazon technicians who are not at all trained for the job have provided evaluation that the issue is resolved. This technician who visited didn’t knw where the temperature control knob is placed inside the refrigerator. He also didn’t know the difference between dual converter fridge and a compressor inveter fridge. However the issue is not yet resolved. Such a waste of money buying electronic item on Amazon.

                "\n  I bought this Microwave oven on Diwali and its really fantastic. Looks fabulous, works brilliantly.  I'd done a thorough research before deciding to select this.  At this price, we are getting Convection Microwave (that means grill+convection) from one of the most reputed & purely Indian brand which is which is really great. There are other brands that are selling grill microwave at this price and their convection is much more expensive than this one.",
                "And yeah, I also received a starter kit which was a surprise because it was clearly mentioned on the listing that there is no starter kit with this product. :)",
                "We also received a free demo from Godrej. The demo guy was very helpful and explained everything quite well. Overall, i would say this was a good investment.  Highly recommended.\n",
                "\n  Received grey colour instead of white front, but my spouse happy with the colour. Too early to say about the performance. Since she has use LG product before hence this is same, but this is convection hence better options. Demo done by Godrej person Munna yesterday late evening. Very nice behaviour and good knowledge of the product. I knew this guy before also , I don't have to follow up for DEMO. Overall till now my experience is excellent. Operation is more silent than my previous LG Microwave.\n",

                "Further, we also tried the recipes given in the booklet. Personally we feel for some of the trivial things like rice and dal the pre-programmed time is more than the gas-cooking time which makes us question the use of microwave which is supposed to be efficient and hassle free cooking.",
                "So according to us the only drawback is that if one sticks to pre-programmed recipes he/she might end up spending more time than required for gas-cooking. However, if you know how to use the microwave then it will complement your gas-cooking making the process more efficient.",

It is making horrible noise during spin function, you literally have to rush and hold the machine as it's moving so horribly. Please don't buy Samsung products because they don't even bother to solve your issues after calling customer service so many times. The person came and test the machine with 4 clothes even after having 6.5 kg capacity. Then machine did not make noise at that time and they updated the issue as resolved and again same story the other day. Really frustrated with this machine and Samsung service. I have uploaded a video of the spin function making that noise. For reference.\n",

Why this was not mentioned or highlighted while purchasing this? Now we need to spend another 2600/- for this.",

Amazon customer care had a different story to tell as she informed me that for the extended warranty the order ID was never generated at the time of my purchase so Amazon can't help while Acko did issue me a warranty document and they do have my warranty details",

It is the worst customer service and delivery service I have met. It was open box verification so delivery guy kept fridge in hall and took photo. Once photo is taken the moves the fridge from hall to kitchen at that time the delivery guy broke the fridge.when I spoke with Amazon customer service they are not responding good and the delivery guy is too harsh. Really worst service from amazon.if you want buy small items from amazon and large appliances go directly to showroom and get it..\n",

Amazon and Whirlpool both together fooled me and doing the same with other customers.

This feature is not available but the company is promoting the product as Convertible.

Ice also started to be in the entire freezer time waste money wast dont by this product\n",

The technician who installed the refrigerator set up the freezer settings told me that was optimum with intellisense, then later filed a complaint and had a technician come who set the freezer to a different mode, said everything would be fine.  Not good still the same problem.  Frost free technology has been around for the last forty years, whirlpool has been in this business for ages, yet this product stinks, had a single door whirlpool before this still have it a single door not frost free, still works after 18 years.  Very disappointed with this product, stay away from it.\n"

Amazon sent their technician and these Amazon technicians who are not at all trained for the job have provided evaluation that the issue is resolved. This technician who visited didn’t knw where the temperature control knob is placed inside the refrigerator.

                "\n  I bought this Microwave oven on Diwali and its really fantastic. Looks fabulous, works brilliantly.  I'd done a thorough research before deciding to select this.  At this price, we are getting Convection Microwave (that means grill+convection) from one of the most reputed & purely Indian brand which is which is really great. There are other brands that are selling grill microwave at this price and their convection is much more expensive than this one.",
                "And yeah, I also received a starter kit which was a surprise because it was clearly mentioned on the listing that there is no starter kit with this product. :)",
                "We also received a free demo from Godrej. The demo guy was very helpful and explained everything quite well. Overall, i would say this was a good investment.  Highly recommended.\n",
                "\n  Received grey colour instead of white front, but my spouse happy with the colour. Too early to say about the performance. Since she has use LG product before hence this is same, but this is convection hence better options. Demo done by Godrej person Munna yesterday late evening. Very nice behaviour and good knowledge of the product. I knew this guy before also , I don't have to follow up for DEMO. Overall till now my experience is excellent. Operation is more silent than my previous LG Microwave.\n",

                "Further, we also tried the recipes given in the booklet. Personally we feel for some of the trivial things like rice and dal the pre-programmed time is more than the gas-cooking time which makes us question the use of microwave which is supposed to be efficient and hassle free cooking.",
                "So according to us the only drawback is that if one sticks to pre-programmed recipes he/she might end up spending more time than required for gas-cooking. However, if you know how to use the microwave then it will complement your gas-cooking making the process more efficient.",

Noone came. Again called them. They said they will escalate. Nothing happened. Then I called Amazon. Amazon said they were fully aware that 9th August was the last date to return and that they would send a technician on 10th August. Told them that the 10 days return poilcy would expire, he said that no problem it is their liability. Received no sms or email so called them on 4 times on 10th August. They kept putting me on hold. The 4th time I told them I want to return the product. She cancelled the service request and put me on hold again.",

After received of item I went to my home town for Doshara celebration without opening of packing. I came back to Guwahati on 14th Oct'2019 and call Godrej technician for installation of machine.  Accordingly,  the packing was opened.  After opening of packing, it was observed that the body of the machine was damage and the Technician refused to install the machine, because he has doubt that the machine may be malfunctioned.  The Technician take the photographs of the machine and go back with a assurance that the machine will be replaced. But, now Gogrej personal told that it can not be replaced.  It is further stated that when I came back from my home town after availing Doshara vacation, in this time the replace window of Amazon was closed.  In this circumstance, please advice me, what can I do to replace the machine please.  Amazon may request to Godrej to replace the same or defect of the machine may rectify.\n",

Worst part is we exchanged our old fridge for this.  So we are stuck with a defective product and all our food has perished.  Poor support.\n",
                "\n  Installation person informed that we need to buy a V Gaurd Stablizer which costs around 2600/- extra now because the existing stablizer will not work for this Refrigerator. Why this was not mentioned or highlighted while purchasing this? Now we need to spend another 2600/- for this.",

                "\n  Let me warn the potential customers from buying Haier refrigerator as the company uses cheap quality paint which starts chipping off and rusting after 1 year of use and though I took extended warranty from Amazon but the warranty service provider Acko refused saying that they do not cover it so check with Amazon. Amazon customer care had a different story to tell as she informed me that for the extended warranty the order ID was never generated at the time of my purchase so Amazon can't help while Acko did issue me a warranty document and they do have my warranty details",

                "I must say that Haier as well as Amazon cheated on me and I definitely would suggest not to go in for such poor quality products of Haier. Also do not get into the trap of Amazon as it charges for extended warranty and some third party service provider will never service the product.",

Amazon kept its promise and delivered within the time and bought it at 18999 and 1000 extra Amazon payback. Haier personnel was at my doorstep within an hour or two after delivery and installed and gave tutorial very gently.

It is the worst customer service and delivery service I have met. It was open box verification so delivery guy kept fridge in hall and took photo. Once photo is taken the moves the fridge from hall to kitchen at that time the delivery guy broke the fridge.when I spoke with Amazon customer service they are not responding good and the delivery guy is too harsh. Really worst service from amazon.if you want buy small items from amazon and large appliances go directly to showroom and get it..\n",

Amazon and Whirlpool both together fooled me and doing the same with other customers.

This feature is not available but the company is promoting the product as Convertible.

Ice also started to be in the entire freezer time waste money wast dont by this product\n",

The technician who installed the refrigerator set up the freezer settings told me that was optimum with intellisense, then later filed a complaint and had a technician come who set the freezer to a different mode, said everything would be fine.  Not good still the same problem.  Frost free technology has been around for the last forty years, whirlpool has been in this business for ages, yet this product stinks, had a single door whirlpool before this still have it a single door not frost free, still works after 18 years.  Very disappointed with this product, stay away from it.\n"
