I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.", 'Good:', '- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!', '- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.', '- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.', '- 6000 Mah battery is BIG', '- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.', '- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE', '- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.', '- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.', '- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.', '- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good', '- Received next day by 11 AM !', 'Not So Good:', '- Not that thin, but ok.', "- Doesn't have Samsung Dex", '- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.', '- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue.

This phone's quality doesn't meet the claims made.", 'Cons:', '1. Camera Quality: Picture quality is just awful. Its worse than a 8MP camera. The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common.', '2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless.', '3. Amazon\'s Policy: In case you don\'t like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day "return" policy to 10 day "replacement" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer\'s site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease.', 'Pros:', '1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light.', '2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open.', '3. Sound: Speaker quality is okay but not upto the mark. In a noisy place you fail to hear the crispness and the boom.\n', '\n  I am using it from 3 days , 6000 mah battery is just for name only, it work for 1-1.25 days only with moderate usage.', "64mp camera doesn't support zoom, camera doesn't support 60fps video recording.", 'Build quality is not good, plastic back with lots of figure prints in few minutes handling, not look new in few seconds.', 'Face unlock very slow.', 'Heat issue which charging and heavy usage', 'Full charge takes more than 3 hrs', 'Would not recommend to buy , if you are looking  for good camera phone', 'go with other brands like oppo or redmi , giving much better quality\n', "\n  The phone was wrapped in dust. Although it was seal packed, still many dust were on screen and back side. It shows security concerns and Amazon, Samsung and seller must draw its attention. How dust can be reached in seal packed box? Now I'm lacking trust in Amazon,Samsung and seller. Either my phone was used or its components might have replaced, as in brand new phone,there exists no dusts because they are built in factory, but here shows how they are playing with the customer and their product.", 'Phone is nice, large battery backup of more than 2 days, 6.4 display is big, camera is perfect and 6GB ram is enough for daily usage.

I am writing this review after using M31s for more than half month. And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only.', 'BUILD QUALITY.', ' Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.', 'DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.', "With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.", 'BATTERY.', "Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested.", 'CAMERA.', 'This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints.', 'PROCESSOR.', 'After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent.', 'SOUND QUALITY.', 'After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect.', 'Bang for the bucks go for it. Thanks Amazon for Safe delivery.\n', '\n  \xa0This is to share my horrible experience with Amazon and Samsung. The phone arrived dead and I have to make multiple calls, emails to team to get it replaced. After technician report confirming that phone is dead they now asking me to go for a refund as product is no longer in stock.\n', '\n  Ordered on Prime day, 6th August 12 AM. Received the phone on 8th August.', 'All aspects of the phone is on par or above the next segment.', 'Display is gorgeous.', "Lookwise it doesn't feel like an M series phone.", 'FP sensor works well although it can store only 3 fingerprints.', "Camera is overall good. Can't say it's a camera centric phone obviously. However it has some good outputs", '6000mah battery with 25W fast charging is awesome. (you get reverse charging as well).', "The only con i felt till now is the exclusion of a phone cover in the box. This might sound silly but I'm one of those guy's who use phone with a cover only to be on the safer side. Just because there is no cover I'm unable to use the phone as my daily driver right now.", 'Come on Samsung. How much will a tpu cover cost for you?? 50Rs??', 'M31s is actually A51 without on screen fp. It has better specs than A51 which retails around 8-9k than M31s which makes this phone one of a kind.', 'The dimensions are also the same as A51. So you can use the same tempered glass but cant use A51 back cover for M31s since it should have the cutout for side mounted fp scanner.', 'Overall a great phone. Value for money I should say. If you are not a heavy gamer this is the best choice around.', 'Will update the review after using the phone for 2 weeks.', 'Till then book your phone and wait for the delivery as it is back-ordered at this moment.\n', '\n  Star rating : 4.5 out of 5', 'Pros :-', 'I. Battery department is top notch', '  1. 6000 mAh Powerful battery', '  2. 25 watt super fast charging (I personally', "  don't like charger faster than this as that", '  would degrade the battery health rapidly)', '  3. USB C to C charging cable with reverse', '  charging.', 'II. Display : No other brand phone can come close to Samsung one in this category even when it has 60 hertz refresh rate.', '  1.It comes with a  FHD+ sAMOLED which', '  is one of the best and neary edge to', '  edge .', '  2. Infinity O camera cut out looks way', "  better than the predecessor's m30 and", '  makes the phone look gorgeous.', 'III. Camera : considering the price I find the both the front and rear cameras to be quiet good. Front one is a 32 MP camera.', 'and in the rear quad setup, the primary sensor is the SONY IMX682  with an f/1.8 lens. The secondary sensor is a 12MP ultra wide lens. And other two are 5MP each depth & macro lens.', 'IV. Side Mounted finger print scanner is absolutely quicker &  convenient than the under display ones.', 'V. Base varient with 128gb storage & 6GB RAM will surely be more than enough for most of the users. If not then one can always insert a Micro SD card ( SIM1 + SIM2 + SD card type slot)', 'VI. Presence of headphone jack is still an advantage. 😂', 'Cons : -', '1. Samsung should have used at least Gorilla glass 5 instead of the 3.', "2. The Exynos 9611 chipset is same as the predecessor's M30. Snapdragon chipset would have been appreciated.", '3. No OIS or EIS is available for either of the cameras', '4. No NFC/wireless charging/water resistance rating (I know demanding these at  this price point is ridiculous as of 2020, just mentioned  to inform )', "5. Packaging is pretty cheap and biggest con is that it doesn't comes with a TPU case. 😬😬", '6. Complete plastic body or "glasstic".', '7. Price : It could have been at least ₹ 1000 cheaper if Samsung tried ( within a month or two price is certainly going to get reduced as sales season are also coming😉)', 'Got this phone for my mother and she is pretty happy with it.', 'I would happily recommend it to anyone over any dominant chinese phone in this segment.', '#SayNo2Chinese wherever possible.\n'], '_id': '5f5e4e1e3e94b9525d64740b',

It is pretty evident that their Ultra Flagship phone is even slower than last year's Snapdragon 855. Afterall Samsung phones only make decent paperweights now as practically they are far inferior when compared to better brand phones costing less than half the price. Having only used Samsung S series since the origin of android I think it is now time to venture with better brands. Predictable that Samsung is soon to be obsolete and make the same mistake Nokia did. While Nokia never cheated their customers I'm sure there's more coming to Samsung.\n", '\n  I pre-ordered two units of this phone.

Good pics but the auto focus fails sometimes , but will fix this issue soon with updates ..... 100X zoom is fabulous , even though pics are little broken , but good pics .

I think if the price would be 25, 000 then it would be acceptable even if that is also too high. But 30, 000 was a premium for sure.", 'Things I liked -', '1. Processor is decent.', '2. Overall display & camera is as I expected', '3. External speaker is good', 'Things I did not like and hoped it had -', "1. A solid aluminium body (because it's 30, 000)", '2. Battery should have been 5000 mah instead of 4500 mah', 'Will add later on...\n', "\n  It is a wonderful phone. The experience has been pretty much overwhelming and I'm really enjoying the handset.", 'Pros:', '1. The screen is absolutely gorgeous to look at. I have seen other AMOLED panels from Xiaomi, Realme and even OnePlus but none match this one.', '2. The performance is pretty good. It feels snappy, no lag or crashes anywhere. Every app opens in a jiffy and there is no hang anywhere. I have also played Call of Duty and Asphalt quite heavily and they ran at the highest visual settings while maintaining very good fps.', '3. The camera is the best in class. Anyone eyeing at A71 would already be knowing that it has best camera in a phone below the 30k price. I am really surprised how well the cameras(both the front and back) work, even in low-light. With gcam mod installed, it performs extremely well. The photos are rich, detailed, sharp and contrasty. The portrait mode also works very nice. No issues whatsoever.', '4. Battery life is good. No issues there. Easily lasts me over a day with moderate gaming, heavy movie watching and using other apps. The fast charge is also quite handy and time saving.', "5. The overall build is very sturdy yet pretty slender and sleek. Even though the back is made of mostly plastic, you won't be able to tell. It looks gorgeous and the benefit of a glastic back is that it won't shatter if it falls.", "6. The audio through the audio jack is very very good. The included earphones are a bonus. I wasn't expecting them and to my surprise they sound very good, slightly better than the Realme bluetooth earphones. So, no complaints here.", "7. Having used stock android, zen ui, miui and colour os, I can firmly say that Samsung's One UI is better than all of them. Obviously it is not as fast as a stock android but the difference is so small I guess you wouldn't even be able to discern it. The OS is very intuitive, easy to use and has many useful features and functionalities which make it probably one of the best android implementation out there (if not the best).", 'Cons:', '1. The on-screen fingerprint reader takes getting used to. It is not as fast as a non on-screen one and sometimes fails to recognise. Overall, it is good, just requires getting used to. However, it could be improved through software patch. Samsung, if you are reading this, kindly address it.', '2. The speaker on the phone is okay. For a 30k phone, the speakers are not justified.', 'So overall it is a wonderful device and I would recommend that if your budget allows, it is definitely worth a try. Sure, there are better specd phones out there for the same or lower price but do they provide you the experience you get with Samsung? No, not even close. Also, inspite of the market rage, I am still not a fan of Chinese brands like Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, etc. So it is also a factor which urged me over to Samsung.', 'I hope you found my review useful.\n', "\n  It's an awesome phone.

Started to fail every single time after 2days of purchasing. Dual sim Never works as when both sim cards are at play, this phone struggles real hard to provide you network.

However, with the Galaxy Note 10 lite, I got the top-class Samsung display, the One UI 2.0, Android 10 running on 6/128 Gigs with a superbly smooth, premium-looking device, a great Camera and the terrific S-pen experience that grows on you with every usage, all under 35k with exchange. I think Samsung has made a killer device that, if it fails, will only be due to its misplaced launch and poor marketing so close to that of the S20 range.', "The phone feels sturdy, looks premium, and works great. For a mostly business user like me, these features, plus all the little software enhancements and customizations that I am allowed to do make it a very attractive device. The processor, even though it isn't the super-latest Snapdragon what-have-you, doesn't feel one bit dull and the battery lasts a whole day and keeps some to spare even with heavy usage. Not to mention most users are still unlikely to notice the 60Hz refresh rate as sub-par since the number of devices that currently support higher refresh rates can be counted on your fingertips.", 'The Camera, frankly speaking, does not "WOW" you but doesn\'t disappoint you either. The colors, like almost all Samsung phones mid-to-high range, are punchy and the video quality is superb. I haven\'t had an exhaustive review of the camera yet but haven\'t found anything to complaint about either. The one thing that I originally was disappointed with was the quality of the fingerprint reader and the face unlocking. I found both to be slow and inaccurate and soon reverted to the good-old grid for unlocking my phone. I am glad it is fixed through a future update recently.', "Overall I think it's a great device that should hopefully find greater appreciation especially among the business user community as well as those who want a phone that stands out in a crowd for all the good reason and doesn't hit the pocket too hard either!\n", '\n  Disappoint by Samsung, Having issues....', '1.

Everything I reported before is still same. But there is a way to get BP and ECG test on to watch by installing modified versions of Samsung health monitor. So there is a way of getting that to work unofficially.', 'I have bought the 45mm BT version of this watch. This is my experience after using it for 2 days.', "Price - Reasonable. I purchased with the launch offer at 28k. It is relatively expensive compared to Android Wear watch options, but I think if you have a Samsung Phone, it might be worth it. I have Samsung Note 10 and Samsung works well with Samsung, but I think with the necessary apps installed it'll work the same way on other Android phones.", "Android Wear vs Tizen: I previously had Fossil Explorist Gen 4 watch which runs on Android Wear. In my personal experience, Android Wear as an operating system needs a lot of work. The Fossil watch was unbearably slow, battery backup was very bad, thought it could do the normal smartwatch things, because of the poor battery, I couldn't use it at all. I just kept the watch on Flight mode and used as a normal watch to display time. My experience here could be biased as I didn't really use Android wear to the fullest. I used it for Navigation a few times, but for that to work, the same Google Maps app has to be open on your phone. It will just tether the content to the watch. On contrary, Tizen doesn't really have Google Maps app or any equivalent navigation alternatives. So it may not be the best for Navigation. Otherwise, the OS basically looks like a modern Smart Watch - with widgets, notification area, quick control panel etc.", "The watch has an option called Automatic WiFi where it will connect to the WiFi in case it gets disconnected from the phone (Bluetooth). This is super useful. On Samsung phones, there is an option called Call and Text on other devices. If you are signed in with your Samsung account and this option is enabled, even when my phone isn't connected to watch, I can still make and receive calls just using watch while it is connected to WiFi. This is such a great option, just like the LTE version, but on Bluetooth watch using WiFi.", "Health Features: The watch DOESN'T have ECG enabled in Indian units. They recently got approval in US from FDA but who knows what regulations are there in India and if it will ever come to this. The hardware required is there in the watch, just that Samsung has to get approvals and enable it through Software. Even last year's Galaxy Watch Active 2 is waiting for this. So don't get the hopes high about this. Other than this, it has Blood Oxygen tracking which works, Heart Rate sensor and automatic workout detection. There are a bunch of pre-set workouts in the watch that it can track. And it does a pretty good job. Using Samsung Health app on phone, you can get access to a lot more third party exercise tutorials.", 'Sleep tracking is also available on the watch and it works great. It can precisely track sleep in my opinion and gives out detailed analysis of sleep pattern and efficiency. Once you connect the watch to phone via Bluetooth, all these data gets synced with phone and you can detailed overview on the Samsung Health app on phone.', "Battery: Battery lasts 2 days if you don't have the always on display. If watch is always on to show time, it takes up a lot more battery. During these 2 days, I used it to track a lot of my exercises, sleep tracking, basic notifications and the battery easily lasted 2 days. But I had the always on disabled. There is a toggle on the watch itself through which you can easily turn this on and off to save battery when required.", 'Miscellaneous: The watch band feels very cheap and light. Though it says leather, the leather band I have with Fossil watch feels a lot premium. This watch band even makes cheap plastic type of noise when you try to wear it. Otherwise, watch is pretty comfortable to wear. Also I prefer the way Fossil looks. This watch looks more like a fitness watch than a regular watch.', 'So to end the review, following are the pros and cons in my opinion:', 'Pros: Great battery backup - almost 2 days, easy to charge using any wireless chargers, has a tonne of features - you can check YouTube videos to know all the features available, works perfectly with Samsung phones, can connect to WiFi in case it is not connected to phone via Bluetooth and you can still make and receive phone calls. This works only with Samsung phones I think, so check about this if this is important.', "Cons: ECG doesn't work yet, watch band feels very light and cheap, no proper Navigation app, lack of app support because of Tizen OS\n", '\n  Good watch\n', '\n  A lot has been promised in Galaxy 3 in several online reviews by the influencer communities on YouTube but The product does not have what it promises. It promised Oxygen level monitoring, blood pressure measurement and ECG.  None of These features exist.', 'The battery life is of approximately two days. Slightly better than I watch.', 'There are no worthwhile apps in the App Store. Something one will sorely miss if one has seen the app ecosystem of Apple and android. And the apps that exist are clunky.', 'On the whole, a bad purchase that occurred due to the misrepresentations on the internet and YouTube.\n', '\n  Its good enough but given the price point, would have liked some more apps. Blood pressure monitoring and ecg not available yet :/', 'Otherwise nice build quality and seems to easy last 2 days with wifi off. I use it mainly for spotify and sleep tracking and notifications so its fine in that regard but for 27K idk', 'EDIT after 3 days usage:', "If you're buying for spotify, stay away. Spotify app on this thing is a STEAMING PILE OF HOT GARBAGE", "When you link to your phone in remote mode, it takes control and it'll work fine for the first use. After that you're completely and utterly screwed. The app will be stuck. I'm not even talking about the watch app, I'm talking about phone. The now playing will he stuck on one song, no restart will fix it, you can only reinstall the phone app where all your downloaded music goes. Cannot recommend for spotify.", 'Edit 2: after 5 days of usage', 'no blood pressure and ecg', 'raise to wake never works when youre in bed', 'myfitnesspal app doesnt work with my note 10 plus', '1 day of battery life with AOD and continuous HR which is reasonable BUT CHARGING TAKES 2 HOURS!!!!!!', "I am dropping my rating from 4 stars to 2 stars not because of the watch, which is pretty and works well enough but because of the abysmal app support. This isn't supposed to just be a watch it's a smart watch, it fails in that aspect. You can get similar stuff for 7-8K\n", '\n  Good product but feels high priced product as this wont serve 100% the purpose of Smart watch. Dosent matter how many watch faces are there you will get bored soon. I mean it will be an option which will make difference sometimes.', 'Lookwise it feels premium.', 'Currently spo2 and heart rate are working which can be measured on 1000 rs devices available in market. Stress management is there but i dint found how to make it automatic. Correct me if any settings need to do.', 'Notification are fine but not fully user-friendly. You can reply some text and whatsapp messages.', 'Battery backup is fine if you limit some unnecessary features. You will get 24 hours battery on standard use.', 'Overall i dint find it amazing but ok product. You can get similar usage/feel on other low cost available smart watches in the market if brand dosent matter to you.\n', '\n  \xa0Looks and build quality -  Really Really amazing.!', "Comfort - Not 100% comfortable while sleeping but yeah it's manageable.", 'Workouts , Step counter and Sleep tracking - Accurate results no difference at all.', 'Battery - Not much tested but samsung claims', " battery life for 2 days so probably will test and update here. Out of box battery was 48% by evening 5pm it went down to 32%.

But there is a way to get BP and ECG test on to watch by installing modified versions of Samsung health monitor. So there is a way of getting that to work unofficially.', 'I have bought the 45mm BT version of this watch. This is my experience after using it for 2 days.', "Price - Reasonable. I purchased with the launch offer at 28k. It is relatively expensive compared to Android Wear watch options, but I think if you have a Samsung Phone, it might be worth it. I have Samsung Note 10 and Samsung works well with Samsung, but I think with the necessary apps installed it'll work the same way on other Android phones.", "Android Wear vs Tizen: I previously had Fossil Explorist Gen 4 watch which runs on Android Wear. In my personal experience, Android Wear as an operating system needs a lot of work. The Fossil watch was unbearably slow, battery backup was very bad, thought it could do the normal smartwatch things, because of the poor battery, I couldn't use it at all. I just kept the watch on Flight mode and used as a normal watch to display time. My experience here could be biased as I didn't really use Android wear to the fullest. I used it for Navigation a few times, but for that to work, the same Google Maps app has to be open on your phone. It will just tether the content to the watch. On contrary, Tizen doesn't really have Google Maps app or any equivalent navigation alternatives. So it may not be the best for Navigation. Otherwise, the OS basically looks like a modern Smart Watch - with widgets, notification area, quick control panel etc.", "The watch has an option called Automatic WiFi where it will connect to the WiFi in case it gets disconnected from the phone (Bluetooth). This is super useful. On Samsung phones, there is an option called Call and Text on other devices. If you are signed in with your Samsung account and this option is enabled, even when my phone isn't connected to watch, I can still make and receive calls just using watch while it is connected to WiFi. This is such a great option, just like the LTE version, but on Bluetooth watch using WiFi.", "Health Features: The watch DOESN'T have ECG enabled in Indian units. They recently got approval in US from FDA but who knows what regulations are there in India and if it will ever come to this. The hardware required is there in the watch, just that Samsung has to get approvals and enable it through Software. Even last year's Galaxy Watch Active 2 is waiting for this. So don't get the hopes high about this. Other than this, it has Blood Oxygen tracking which works, Heart Rate sensor and automatic workout detection. There are a bunch of pre-set workouts in the watch that it can track. And it does a pretty good job. Using Samsung Health app on phone, you can get access to a lot more third party exercise tutorials.", 'Sleep tracking is also available on the watch and it works great. It can precisely track sleep in my opinion and gives out detailed analysis of sleep pattern and efficiency. Once you connect the watch to phone via Bluetooth, all these data gets synced with phone and you can detailed overview on the Samsung Health app on phone.', "Battery: Battery lasts 2 days if you don't have the always on display. If watch is always on to show time, it takes up a lot more battery. During these 2 days, I used it to track a lot of my exercises, sleep tracking, basic notifications and the battery easily lasted 2 days. But I had the always on disabled. There is a toggle on the watch itself through which you can easily turn this on and off to save battery when required.", 'Miscellaneous: The watch band feels very cheap and light. Though it says leather, the leather band I have with Fossil watch feels a lot premium. This watch band even makes cheap plastic type of noise when you try to wear it. Otherwise, watch is pretty comfortable to wear. Also I prefer the way Fossil looks. This watch looks more like a fitness watch than a regular watch.', 'So to end the review, following are the pros and cons in my opinion:', 'Pros: Great battery backup - almost 2 days, easy to charge using any wireless chargers, has a tonne of features - you can check YouTube videos to know all the features available, works perfectly with Samsung phones, can connect to WiFi in case it is not connected to phone via Bluetooth and you can still make and receive phone calls. This works only with Samsung phones I think, so check about this if this is important.', "Cons: ECG doesn't work yet, watch band feels very light and cheap, no proper Navigation app, lack of app support because of Tizen OS\n", '\n  Good watch\n', '\n  A lot has been promised in Galaxy 3 in several online reviews by the influencer communities on YouTube but The product does not have what it promises. It promised Oxygen level monitoring, blood pressure measurement and ECG.  None of These features exist.', 'The battery life is of approximately two days. Slightly better than I watch.', 'There are no worthwhile apps in the App Store. Something one will sorely miss if one has seen the app ecosystem of Apple and android. And the apps that exist are clunky.', 'On the whole, a bad purchase that occurred due to the misrepresentations on the internet and YouTube.\n', '\n  Its good enough but given the price point, would have liked some more apps. Blood pressure monitoring and ecg not available yet :/', 'Otherwise nice build quality and seems to easy last 2 days with wifi off. I use it mainly for spotify and sleep tracking and notifications so its fine in that regard but for 27K idk', 'EDIT after 3 days usage:', "If you're buying for spotify, stay away. Spotify app on this thing is a STEAMING PILE OF HOT GARBAGE", "When you link to your phone in remote mode, it takes control and it'll work fine for the first use. After that you're completely and utterly screwed. The app will be stuck. I'm not even talking about the watch app, I'm talking about phone. The now playing will he stuck on one song, no restart will fix it, you can only reinstall the phone app where all your downloaded music goes. Cannot recommend for spotify.", 'Edit 2: after 5 days of usage', 'no blood pressure and ecg', 'raise to wake never works when youre in bed', 'myfitnesspal app doesnt work with my note 10 plus', '1 day of battery life with AOD and continuous HR which is reasonable BUT CHARGING TAKES 2 HOURS!!!!!!', "I am dropping my rating from 4 stars to 2 stars not because of the watch, which is pretty and works well enough but because of the abysmal app support. This isn't supposed to just be a watch it's a smart watch, it fails in that aspect. You can get similar stuff for 7-8K\n", '\n  Good product but feels high priced product as this wont serve 100% the purpose of Smart watch. Dosent matter how many watch faces are there you will get bored soon. I mean it will be an option which will make difference sometimes.', 'Lookwise it feels premium.', 'Currently spo2 and heart rate are working which can be measured on 1000 rs devices available in market. Stress management is there but i dint found how to make it automatic. Correct me if any settings need to do.', 'Notification are fine but not fully user-friendly. You can reply some text and whatsapp messages.', 'Battery backup is fine if you limit some unnecessary features. You will get 24 hours battery on standard use.', 'Overall i dint find it amazing but ok product. You can get similar usage/feel on other low cost available smart watches in the market if brand dosent matter to you.\n', '\n  \xa0Looks and build quality -  Really Really amazing.!', "Comfort - Not 100% comfortable while sleeping but yeah it's manageable.", 'Workouts , Step counter and Sleep tracking - Accurate results no difference at all.', 'Battery - Not much tested but samsung claims', " battery life for 2 days so probably will test and update here. Out of box battery was 48% by evening 5pm it went down to 32%. So yeah expecting a full 2 days battery on normal usage also it's better to use goodnight mode while sleeping to save some.", 'Customization - Hell lot of customizations you can customise smaller to smaller things to make your experience with this watch much easy and comfortable.', 'Would be much better if samsung would have provided some straps too.\n'], '_id': '5f5e53a33e94b9525d64750d', 'storeProductId': 'B08FN55MSH', 'storeLink': 'https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-Bluetooth-Mystic-SM-R840NZSAINS/dp/B08FN55MSH/ref=sr_1_51_sspa?dchild=1&keywords=smart+watch&qid=1600015400&sr=8-51-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUE5RkFYVVJZWFhZSk0mZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTAyMjk0NTBSQ1RGS0tOTlZJUDUmZW5jcnlwdGVkQWRJZD1BMDEzNTA0MDExUDMyRTNMN1VINFQmd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGZfbmV4dCZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=&tag=revmeup-21', 'storeName': 'amazon', 'storePrice': '32990', 'store_mrp': '34990', 'store_logo': 'https://i.pinimg.com/564x/42/a7/86/42a7861bb1a403af534b18986ab4e198.jpg', 'storeDescription': 'Circular Super amoled (360X360) , Full Color, Always On Display, Precision Rotating bezel for App Navigation, Leather Strap, Enhanced Accelerometer for Fall Detection, Smart Functions : Image view of Notifications, Smart reply, Auto chat history, and AR Emoji/Bitmoji, Compatibility : - Android : Android 5.0 (L OS)\xa0or higher, RAM 1.5GB above (Samsung/Non\xa0Samsung) iOS : iPhone 5 and above, iOS 9.0 or above, Advanced Health Monitoring - Enhanced Running Analysis, Sleep Tracking, Blood Oxygen, 120+ Home Workout Programs', 'rating': '4.2 out of 5 stars', 'instock': 'In stock.', 'storeTechnicalDetails': {'Brand': 'Samsung', 'Manufacturer': 'Samsung india pvt ltd', 'Series': 'Galaxy Noblesse_Watch3_45mm_BT', 'Colour': 'Mystic Silver', 'Item Height': '46 Millimeters', 'Item Width': '45 Millimeters', 'Product Dimensions': '11 x 45 x 46 cm 54 Grams', 'Batteries': '1 Lithium ion batteries required included', 'Item model number': 'SMR840NZSAINS', 'Wireless Type': 'Bluetooth', 'Are Batteries Included': 'Yes', 'Lithium Battery Energy Content': '127 Watt Hours', 'Number Of Lithium Ion Cells': '1', 'Included Components': 'Wach Charing Deckuser manual', 'Country of Origin': 'India', 'Item Weight': '54 g'}, 'storeAdditionalDetails': {'ASIN': 'B08FN55MSH', '42 out of 5 stars': 'Best Sellers Rank', '11584 in Electronics': 'See Top 100 in Electronics', 'Date First Available': '11 August 2020', 'Packed By': 'Samsung India Electronics Pvt ltd', 'Imported By': 'Samsung India Electronics Pvt ltd', 'Item Dimensions LxWxH': '11 x 45 x 46 Millimeters', 'Product Name': 'Watch'}}], 'category': 'Electronics', 'subcategory': 'smart watch', 'description': 'Circular Super amoled (360X360) , Full Color, Always On Display, Precision Rotating bezel for App Navigation, Leather Strap, Enhanced Accelerometer for Fall Detection, Smart Functions : Image view of Notifications, Smart reply, Auto chat history, and AR Emoji/Bitmoji, Compatibility : - Android : Android 5.0 (L OS)\xa0or higher, RAM 1.5GB above (Samsung/Non\xa0Samsung) iOS : iPhone 5 and above, iOS 9.0 or above, Advanced Health Monitoring - Enhanced Running Analysis, Sleep Tracking, Blood Oxygen, 120+ Home Workout Programs'}, {'timestamp': '', 'photos': ['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41DNRHoFkrL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51xC3mvQcQL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41hIjMxSOEL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41u0tkrZvwL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41sUyvr8g6L.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/21UtQ2XLmdL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/21MZmvL2YxL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/transparent-pixel.gif'], 'specification': [], '_id': '5f5e564a3e94b9525d647598', 'product_name': 'Samsung Galaxy M01 Core (Red, 2GB RAM, 32GB Storage) with No Cost EMI/Additional Exchange Offers', 'product_id': '41ednv0g6387zyb', 'brand_name': 'Samsung', 'stores': [{'reviews': ['\n  Thank you samsung and Amazon for timely rakshabandhan delivery.Now for readers this is a review unbiased and written after testing and continuous usage :-', "Pro's", '1.Screen ppi is great as entry level device✌', '2.Battery backup is awesome thanks to samsungs R&D even with .7mamp charger.👀', '3.Android go version 10 is cute without craps', '4.Reading pdfs is easy and comfort for eyes atleast samsung has guts to say the truth.', '5.No lag till now because i dont need gaming other than that all regular even without go apps are nicely running.', '6.fingerprint and face lock i dont need so good they are not provided.', '7.Call quality is okay.Speaker is normal.', '8.For music lovers dowload any music app with equilizer will be fine.', '9.16gb/32gb and sd card is okay.', '10.Auto smart memory cleaner(use smart manager in settings once a day) for smooth RAM functioning and ROM cleaning🤗', '11.

And I would say that I hated it coz of the problems that i faced.', 'Problem 1 : its fails to connect sometimes with phone whereas phone says it is connected. (Check pic)', 'Problem 2: most times it doesn’t send notifications from phone to watch from apps like whatsapp, Snapchat etc. (FYI I am using redmi note 5 & i have check each and every possible setting I could.)', 'Battery sucks', 'Sometimes hangs', 'Long story short i brought on day one found problems returned 2nd day. I’ll go for android wear coz that has better eco system. And samsung just ruins everything when it goes on the other direction from google.\n', '\n  It is best smartwatch i have ever used,', 'TIzen OS has very less apps compare to android wear OS and battery backup time is less', 'instead of these it is a Great watch for android compatible devices\n', '\n  So far everything is damn good except certain app functions Especially GPS, though the watch is capable of GPS functionality, there is no app available in Gear store to use GPS in watch. Apart from that, I see everyone mentioning abt battery (42mm) , i managed to use the watch for 4 days continues usage with Bluetooth and wireless disabled) and 3 days with just Bluetooth enabled. I am using the watch with Iphone, so far have not faced any connectivity issue or any other (except the GPS mentioned above). The Hrt beat tracker, steps and running trackers were spot on. The only concern i have is with regards to warranty, the box seemed like it was a return d product, i will be visiting Samsung service centre tomorrow &  will keep you posted more about it. I am yet to explore more functionalities. (I figured out advance steps tracking with GPS, yesterday). Oh! The speakers are not so good( i didn’t mind, whos is bothered abt watch’s speaker).\n', '\n  Given a choice I would not even rate this watch 3 on 5. But after using my first smartwatch 4 years back and then using one more before I got on to this, I rated it 4. And below are the reasons why.', '1. Smartwatch industry is still in nascent stage. Because the basic purpose of a watch is still not fulfilled while everyone is trying to be smart. That is - battery life. 90% smartwatches are not giving 4 full days of battery with all functionalities. Those who claim 7/10/14 days battery life, has some conditions to them (no always on, only trackers/band, limited OS functionalities and so on).', '2. No Watch brand has a clear objective what they want to achieve. Health or watch functions or both.', '3. Wear OS is failure, hence every second watch has their own ecosystem, making it more confusing and no proper updates/guidance by Google unlike Android platform.', '4. Smartwatches are still steeply priced and not worth the money.', 'Now, let us come to this watch. I bought this after using Huawei Watch (1st Gen) and Huawei Magic and Gear Fit 2 Pro. This gives 2 days of battery with continuous Bluetooth and all notifications. That is shame. I see people who have bought this for 25K+ which was very steep. I got this for 15 after a year of its release during a sale and I do not feel it is worth the money.', 'I wanted to buy Watch GT, but stayed away from it after using Watch Magic, they are just smartbands with very limited functionalities. Fitbit and Garmin are also the same. Left is Huami watches which are cheaper, value for money but just better smart bands than Huawei, Fitbit and Garmin. LG and Fossil watches are nothing but scams.', 'Pluses of this watch is my Samsung ecosystem, syncs effortlessly with my Samsung phone or Galaxy Buds which also charges wirelssly either on my wirelsss charger or back of the phone.', 'The bezels are very thick, battery life is below par, thickness is not impressive and overall not at all bang for your buck.', 'But then the only watch which looks and feels better than this one right now is Watch Active 2 which is 12K more than this.  Or Amazefit GTS and GTR which are 7K less (with compromises).', 'Difficult choice. If you can resist the temptation, stay away from smartwatches.\n', "\n  I am extremely satisfied using the Galaxy Watch for the past 4 months. I have the 42mm model Galaxy watch. It's very light and feels comfortable wearing the whole day. But the best thing about this is the battery life. It can stay up to 3 to 4 days with regular use on a single full charge. Bixby needs some improvement. Overall it's something worth buying.\n", "\n  The watch is good but lots of improvements are expected. While battery is not that big issue if you are not frequent traveller. Since, it has wireless charger so instead of wearing the watch whole day you can put the watch on charger and that's enough. It's takes 2.5 to 3hours for charging from 0 to100. Look is not that great when I compare it with watch of even Rs 4000.00. Better to go for bigger version of this watch. The technology is in nacent stage so it's like buying Nokia 6300 at 32000.00. Watch faces are few to choose which are unpaid and has very less app. Storage space is another issue with this watch. I would better suggest to go for the watch which has better look than this. As all the smartwatch are almost at the same stage where they are struggling hard to make more out of it. My honest opinion is you may not enjoy this watch when it comes to its pricing and features it offers unless you are a fan of Samsung.\n", '\n  This is a perfect size dial for people with small wrists.

performance,  best display.\n', "\n  This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.", 'Good:', '- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!', '- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.', '- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.', '- 6000 Mah battery is BIG', '- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.', '- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE', '- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.', '- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.', '- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.', '- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good', '- Received next day by 11 AM !', 'Not So Good:', '- Not that thin, but ok.', "- Doesn't have Samsung Dex", '- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.', '- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :)', '- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.', 'Feedback', '- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.', "- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.", 'Go for it without any doubt.\n', '\n  3rd class front camera. 32 MP front camera n looks like 2mp front camera.

This phone's quality doesn't meet the claims made.", 'Cons:', '1. Camera Quality: Picture quality is just awful. Its worse than a 8MP camera. The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common.', '2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless.', '3. Amazon\'s Policy: In case you don\'t like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day "return" policy to 10 day "replacement" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer\'s site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease.', 'Pros:', '1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light.', '2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open.', '3. Sound: Speaker quality is okay but not upto the mark. In a noisy place you fail to hear the crispness and the boom.\n', '\n  I am using it from 3 days , 6000 mah battery is just for name only, it work for 1-1.25 days only with moderate usage.', "64mp camera doesn't support zoom, camera doesn't support 60fps video recording.", 'Build quality is not good, plastic back with lots of figure prints in few minutes handling, not look new in few seconds.', 'Face unlock very slow.', 'Heat issue which charging and heavy usage', 'Full charge takes more than 3 hrs', 'Would not recommend to buy , if you are looking  for good camera phone', 'go with other brands like oppo or redmi , giving much better quality\n', "\n  The phone was wrapped in dust. Although it was seal packed, still many dust were on screen and back side. It shows security concerns and Amazon, Samsung and seller must draw its attention. How dust can be reached in seal packed box? Now I'm lacking trust in Amazon,Samsung and seller.

I am writing this review after using M31s for more than half month.

My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.', 'DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.', "With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.", 'BATTERY.', "Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously.

Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints.', 'PROCESSOR.', 'After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent.', 'SOUND QUALITY.', 'After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect.', 'Bang for the bucks go for it. Thanks Amazon for Safe delivery.\n', '\n  \xa0This is to share my horrible experience with Amazon and Samsung.

Received the phone on 8th August.', 'All aspects of the phone is on par or above the next segment.', 'Display is gorgeous.', "Lookwise it doesn't feel like an M series phone.", 'FP sensor works well although it can store only 3 fingerprints.', "Camera is overall good. Can't say it's a camera centric phone obviously. However it has some good outputs", '6000mah battery with 25W fast charging is awesome. (you get reverse charging as well).', "The only con i felt till now is the exclusion of a phone cover in the box. This might sound silly but I'm one of those guy's who use phone with a cover only to be on the safer side. Just because there is no cover I'm unable to use the phone as my daily driver right now.", 'Come on Samsung. How much will a tpu cover cost for you?? 50Rs??', 'M31s is actually A51 without on screen fp. It has better specs than A51 which retails around 8-9k than M31s which makes this phone one of a kind.', 'The dimensions are also the same as A51. So you can use the same tempered glass but cant use A51 back cover for M31s since it should have the cutout for side mounted fp scanner.', 'Overall a great phone. Value for money I should say. If you are not a heavy gamer this is the best choice around.', 'Will update the review after using the phone for 2 weeks.', 'Till then book your phone and wait for the delivery as it is back-ordered at this moment.\n', '\n  Star rating : 4.5 out of 5', 'Pros :-', 'I. Battery department is top notch', '  1. 6000 mAh Powerful battery', '  2. 25 watt super fast charging (I personally', "  don't like charger faster than this as that", '  would degrade the battery health rapidly)', '  3. USB C to C charging cable with reverse', '  charging.', 'II. Display : No other brand phone can come close to Samsung one in this category even when it has 60 hertz refresh rate.', '  1.It comes with a  FHD+ sAMOLED which', '  is one of the best and neary edge to', '  edge .', '  2. Infinity O camera cut out looks way', "  better than the predecessor's m30 and", '  makes the phone look gorgeous.', 'III. Camera : considering the price I find the both the front and rear cameras to be quiet good. Front one is a 32 MP camera.', 'and in the rear quad setup, the primary sensor is the SONY IMX682  with an f/1.8 lens. The secondary sensor is a 12MP ultra wide lens. And other two are 5MP each depth & macro lens.', 'IV. Side Mounted finger print scanner is absolutely quicker &  convenient than the under display ones.', 'V. Base varient with 128gb storage & 6GB RAM will surely be more than enough for most of the users. If not then one can always insert a Micro SD card ( SIM1 + SIM2 + SD card type slot)', 'VI. Presence of headphone jack is still an advantage. 😂', 'Cons : -', '1. Samsung should have used at least Gorilla glass 5 instead of the 3.', "2. The Exynos 9611 chipset is same as the predecessor's M30. Snapdragon chipset would have been appreciated.", '3. No OIS or EIS is available for either of the cameras', '4. No NFC/wireless charging/water resistance rating (I know demanding these at  this price point is ridiculous as of 2020, just mentioned  to inform )', "5. Packaging is pretty cheap and biggest con is that it doesn't comes with a TPU case. 😬😬", '6. Complete plastic body or "glasstic".', '7. Price : It could have been at least ₹ 1000 cheaper if Samsung tried ( within a month or two price is certainly going to get reduced as sales season are also coming😉)', 'Got this phone for my mother

I think if the price would be 25, 000 then it would be acceptable even if that is also too high. But 30, 000 was a premium for sure.", 'Things I liked -', '1. Processor is decent.', '2. Overall display & camera is as I expected', '3. External speaker is good', 'Things I did not like and hoped it had -', "1. A solid aluminium body (because it's 30, 000)", '2. Battery should have been 5000 mah instead of 4500 mah', 'Will add later on...\n', "\n  It is a wonderful phone. The experience has been pretty much overwhelming and I'm really enjoying the handset.", 'Pros:', '1. The screen is absolutely gorgeous to look at. I have seen other AMOLED panels from Xiaomi, Realme and even OnePlus but none match this one.', '2. The performance is pretty good. It feels snappy, no lag or crashes anywhere. Every app opens in a jiffy and there is no hang anywhere. I have also played Call of Duty and Asphalt quite heavily and they ran at the highest visual settings while maintaining very good fps.', '3. The camera is the best in class. Anyone eyeing at A71 would already be knowing that it has best camera in a phone below the 30k price. I am really surprised how well the cameras(both the front and back) work, even in low-light. With gcam mod installed, it performs extremely well. The photos are rich, detailed, sharp and contrasty. The portrait mode also works very nice. No issues whatsoever.', '4. Battery life is good. No issues there. Easily lasts me over a day with moderate gaming, heavy movie watching and using other apps. The fast charge is also quite handy and time saving.', "5. The overall build is very sturdy yet pretty slender and sleek. Even though the back is made of mostly plastic, you won't be able to tell. It looks gorgeous and the benefit of a glastic back is that it won't shatter if it falls.", "6. The audio through the audio jack is very very good. The included earphones are a bonus. I wasn't expecting them and to my surprise they sound very good, slightly better than the Realme bluetooth earphones. So, no complaints here.", "7. Having used stock android, zen ui, miui and colour os, I can firmly say that Samsung's One UI is better than all of them. Obviously it is not as fast as a stock android but the difference is so small I guess you wouldn't even be able to discern it. The OS is very intuitive, easy to use and has many useful features and functionalities which make it probably one of the best android implementation out there (if not the best).", 'Cons:', '1. The on-screen fingerprint reader takes getting used to. It is not as fast as a non on-screen one and sometimes fails to recognise. Overall, it is good, just requires getting used to. However, it could be improved through software patch. Samsung, if you are reading this, kindly address it.', '2. The speaker on the phone is okay. For a 30k phone, the speakers are not justified.', 'So overall it is a wonderful device and I would recommend that if your budget allows, it is definitely worth a try. Sure, there are better specd phones out there for the same or lower price but do they provide you the experience you get with Samsung? No, not even close. Also, inspite of the market rage, I am still not a fan of Chinese brands like Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, etc. So it is also a factor which urged me over to Samsung.', 'I hope you found my review useful.\n', "\n  It's an awesome phone. Cameras are wonderful. I m very happy with its overall performance. Battery seems to last longer after a days use. Nice display.\n", '\n  I am writing this review after a week of usage..', 'Number one feature of this phone is the super amoled display.Performance is good, handles heavy games with ease. Cameras are great too..\n', "\n  Disaster of a phone. I bought it directly from Samsung. It's advertised as being capable of 1080p 120fps and 240fps but if you record, it saved as 720p. There's also no live focus video. Save your money\n", '\n  Fantastic phone and the best by samsung fr this price range till now. if u r a samsung lover and this price is fine fr u..then this is fr u ! everything abt is awsm and dnt ever compare and samsung phone with redmi or realme. u cn compare those two but samsung is samsung..it is another level.\n', '\n  It delivers everything it promises.

However, with the Galaxy Note 10 lite, I got the top-class Samsung display, the One UI 2.0, Android 10 running on 6/128 Gigs with a superbly smooth, premium-looking device, a great Camera and the terrific S-pen experience that grows on you with every usage, all under 35k with exchange. I think Samsung has made a killer device that, if it fails, will only be due to its misplaced launch and poor marketing so close to that of the S20 range.', "The phone feels sturdy, looks premium, and works great. For a mostly business user like me, these features, plus all the little software enhancements and customizations that I am allowed to do make it a very attractive device. The processor, even though it isn't the super-latest Snapdragon what-have-you, doesn't feel one bit dull and the battery lasts a whole day and keeps some to spare even with heavy usage. Not to mention most users are still unlikely to notice the 60Hz refresh rate as sub-par since the number of devices that currently support higher refresh rates can be counted on your fingertips.", 'The Camera, frankly speaking, does not "WOW" you but doesn\'t disappoint you either. The colors, like almost all Samsung phones mid-to-high range, are punchy and the video quality is superb. I haven\'t had an exhaustive review of the camera yet but haven\'t found anything to complaint about either. The one thing that I originally was disappointed with was the quality of the fingerprint reader and the face unlocking. I found both to be slow and inaccurate and soon reverted to the good-old grid for unlocking my phone. I am glad it is fixed through a future update recently.', "Overall I think it's a great device that should hopefully find greater appreciation especially among the business user community as well as those who want a phone that stands out in a crowd for all the good reason and doesn't hit the pocket too hard either!\n", '\n  Disappoint by Samsung, Having issues....', '1.

Everything I reported before is still same. But there is a way to get BP and ECG test on to watch by installing modified versions of Samsung health monitor. So there is a way of getting that to work unofficially.', 'I have bought the 45mm BT version of this watch. This is my experience after using it for 2 days.', "Price - Reasonable. I purchased with the launch offer at 28k. It is relatively expensive compared to Android Wear watch options, but I think if you have a Samsung Phone, it might be worth it. I have Samsung Note 10 and Samsung works well with Samsung, but I think with the necessary apps installed it'll work the same way on other Android phones.", "Android Wear vs Tizen: I previously had Fossil Explorist Gen 4 watch which runs on Android Wear. In my personal experience, Android Wear as an operating system needs a lot of work. The Fossil watch was unbearably slow, battery backup was very bad, thought it could do the normal smartwatch things, because of the poor battery, I couldn't use it at all. I just kept the watch on Flight mode and used as a normal watch to display time. My experience here could be biased as I didn't really use Android wear to the fullest. I used it for Navigation a few times, but for that to work, the same Google Maps app has to be open on your phone. It will just tether the content to the watch. On contrary, Tizen doesn't really have Google Maps app or any equivalent navigation alternatives. So it may not be the best for Navigation. Otherwise, the OS basically looks like a modern Smart Watch - with widgets, notification area, quick control panel etc.", "The watch has an option called Automatic WiFi where it will connect to the WiFi in case it gets disconnected from the phone (Bluetooth). This is super useful. On Samsung phones, there is an option called Call and Text on other devices. If you are signed in with your Samsung account and this option is enabled, even when my phone isn't connected to watch, I can still make and receive calls just using watch while it is connected to WiFi. This is such a great option, just like the LTE version, but on Bluetooth watch using WiFi.", "Health Features: The watch DOESN'T have ECG enabled in Indian units. They recently got approval in US from FDA but who knows what regulations are there in India and if it will ever come to this. The hardware required is there in the watch, just that Samsung has to get approvals and enable it through Software. Even last year's Galaxy Watch Active 2 is waiting for this. So don't get the hopes high about this. Other than this, it has Blood Oxygen tracking which works, Heart Rate sensor and automatic workout detection. There are a bunch of pre-set workouts in the watch that it can track. And it does a pretty good job. Using Samsung Health app on phone, you can get access to a lot more third party exercise tutorials.", 'Sleep tracking is also available on the watch and it works great. It can precisely track sleep in my opinion and gives out detailed analysis of sleep pattern and efficiency. Once you connect the watch to phone via Bluetooth, all these data gets synced with phone and you can detailed overview on the Samsung Health app on phone.', "Battery: Battery lasts 2 days if you don't have the always on display. If watch is always on to show time, it takes up a lot more battery. During these 2 days, I used it to track a lot of my exercises, sleep tracking, basic notifications and the battery easily lasted 2 days. But I had the always on disabled. There is a toggle on the watch itself through which you can easily turn this on and off to save battery when required.", 'Miscellaneous: The watch band feels very cheap and light. Though it says leather, the leather band I have with Fossil watch feels a lot premium. This watch band even makes cheap plastic type of noise when you try to wear it.

But there is a way to get BP and ECG test on to watch by installing modified versions of Samsung health monitor. So there is a way of getting that to work unofficially.', 'I have bought the 45mm BT version of this watch. This is my experience after using it for 2 days.', "Price - Reasonable. I purchased with the launch offer at 28k. It is relatively expensive compared to Android Wear watch options, but I think if you have a Samsung Phone, it might be worth it. I have Samsung Note 10 and Samsung works well with Samsung, but I think with the necessary apps installed it'll work the same way on other Android phones.", "Android Wear vs Tizen: I previously had Fossil Explorist Gen 4 watch which runs on Android Wear. In my personal experience, Android Wear as an operating system needs a lot of work. The Fossil watch was unbearably slow, battery backup was very bad, thought it could do the normal smartwatch things, because of the poor battery, I couldn't use it at all. I just kept the watch on Flight mode and used as a normal watch to display time. My experience here could be biased as I didn't really use Android wear to the fullest. I used it for Navigation a few times, but for that to work, the same Google Maps app has to be open on your phone. It will just tether the content to the watch. On contrary, Tizen doesn't really have Google Maps app or any equivalent navigation alternatives. So it may not be the best for Navigation. Otherwise, the OS basically looks like a modern Smart Watch - with widgets, notification area, quick control panel etc.", "The watch has an option called Automatic WiFi where it will connect to the WiFi in case it gets disconnected from the phone (Bluetooth). This is super useful. On Samsung phones, there is an option called Call and Text on other devices. If you are signed in with your Samsung account and this option is enabled, even when my phone isn't connected to watch, I can still make and receive calls just using watch while it is connected to WiFi. This is such a great option, just like the LTE version, but on Bluetooth watch using WiFi.", "Health Features: The watch DOESN'T have ECG enabled in Indian units. They recently got approval in US from FDA but who knows what regulations are there in India and if it will ever come to this. The hardware required is there in the watch, just that Samsung has to get approvals and enable it through Software. Even last year's Galaxy Watch Active 2 is waiting for this. So don't get the hopes high about this. Other than this, it has Blood Oxygen tracking which works, Heart Rate sensor and automatic workout detection. There are a bunch of pre-set workouts in the watch that it can track. And it does a pretty good job. Using Samsung Health app on phone, you can get access to a lot more third party exercise tutorials.", 'Sleep tracking is also available on the watch and it works great. It can precisely track sleep in my opinion and gives out detailed analysis of sleep pattern and efficiency. Once you connect the watch to phone via Bluetooth, all these data gets synced with phone and you can detailed overview on the Samsung Health app on phone.', "Battery: Battery lasts 2 days if you don't have the always on display. If watch is always on to show time, it takes up a lot more battery. During these 2 days, I used it to track a lot of my exercises, sleep tracking, basic notifications and the battery easily lasted 2 days. But I had the always on disabled. There is a toggle on the watch itself through which you can easily turn this on and off to save battery when required.", 'Miscellaneous: The watch band feels very cheap and light. Though it says leather, the leather band I have with Fossil watch feels a lot premium. This watch band even makes cheap plastic type of noise when you try to wear it. Otherwise, watch is pretty comfortable to wear. Also I prefer the way Fossil looks.

And I would say that I hated it coz of the problems that i faced.', 'Problem 1 : its fails to connect sometimes with phone whereas phone says it is connected.

Apart from that, I see everyone mentioning abt battery (42mm) , i managed to use the watch for 4 days continues usage with Bluetooth and wireless disabled) and 3 days with just Bluetooth enabled. I am using the watch with Iphone, so far have not faced any connectivity issue or any other (except the GPS mentioned above). The Hrt beat tracker, steps and running trackers were spot on. The only concern i have is with regards to warranty, the box seemed like it was a return d product, i will be visiting Samsung service centre tomorrow &  will keep you posted more about it. I am yet to explore more functionalities. (I figured out advance steps tracking with GPS, yesterday). Oh! The speakers are not so good( i didn’t mind, whos is bothered abt watch’s speaker).\n', '\n  Given a choice I would not even rate this watch 3 on 5. But after using my first smartwatch 4 years back and then using one more before I got on to this, I rated it 4. And below are the reasons why.', '1. Smartwatch industry is still in nascent stage. Because the basic purpose of a watch is still not fulfilled while everyone is trying to be smart. That is - battery life. 90% smartwatches are not giving 4 full days of battery with all functionalities. Those who claim 7/10/14 days battery life, has some conditions to them (no always on, only trackers/band, limited OS functionalities and so on).', '2. No Watch brand has a clear objective what they want to achieve. Health or watch functions or both.', '3. Wear OS is failure, hence every second watch has their own ecosystem, making it more confusing and no proper updates/guidance by Google unlike Android platform.', '4. Smartwatches are still steeply priced and not worth the money.', 'Now, let us come to this watch. I bought this after using Huawei Watch (1st Gen) and Huawei Magic and Gear Fit 2 Pro. This gives 2 days of battery with continuous Bluetooth and all notifications. That is shame. I see people who have bought this for 25K+ which was very steep. I got this for 15 after a year of its release during a sale and I do not feel it is worth the money.', 'I wanted to buy Watch GT, but stayed away from it after using Watch Magic, they are just smartbands with very limited functionalities. Fitbit and Garmin are also the same. Left is Huami watches which are cheaper, value for money but just better smart bands than Huawei, Fitbit and Garmin. LG and Fossil watches are nothing but scams.', 'Pluses of this watch is my Samsung ecosystem, syncs effortlessly with my Samsung phone or Galaxy Buds which also charges wirelssly either on my wirelsss charger or back of the phone.', 'The bezels are very thick, battery life is below par, thickness is not impressive and overall not at all bang for your buck.', 'But then the only watch which looks and feels better than this one right now is Watch Active 2 which is 12K more than this.  Or Amazefit GTS and GTR which are 7K less (with compromises).', 'Difficult choice. If you can resist the temptation, stay away from smartwatches.\n', "\n  I am extremely satisfied using the Galaxy Watch for the past 4 months. I have the 42mm model Galaxy watch. It's very light and feels comfortable wearing the whole day. But the best thing about this is the battery life. It can stay up to 3 to 4 days with regular use on a single full charge. Bixby needs some improvement. Overall it's something worth buying.\n", "\n  The watch is good but lots of improvements are expected. While battery is not that big issue if you are not frequent traveller. Since, it has wireless charger so instead of wearing the watch whole day you can put the watch on charger and that's enough. It's takes 2.5 to 3hours for charging from 0 to100. Look is not that great when I compare it with watch of even Rs 4000.00. Better to go for bigger version of this watch. The technology is in nacent stage so it's like buying Nokia 6300 at 32000.00. Watch faces are few to choose which are unpaid and has very less app. Storage space is another issue with this watch. I would better suggest to go for the watch which has better look than this. As all the smartwatch are almost at the same stage where they are struggling hard to make more out of it. My honest opinion is you may not enjoy this watch when it comes to its pricing and features it offers unless you are a fan of Samsung.\n", '\n  This is a perfect size dial for people with small wrists.

I had my doubts buying another Redmi device after my mom bought one for herself 1 year ago. It got the annoying ads problem. But so far I'm yet to see my first ad. You have to be careful the first time you switch on the phone out of the box and untick all the personalization stuffs. Same goes for the first time opening any apps after booting. If then, u'll probably never see any ads like me. The battery is what they promised and it holds up to more than 1and half days for moderate usage. And the fast charger is pretty cool. 1 hour from 0 to 100%. It has Navic which is really accurate(tested it with GPS). It's really big but its right for me since my hands are big too. But probably for lots of people they'll have to always use both their hands for operating the phone, my mom finds it pretty hard to use. So, my honest review is, in 2020 this is an awesome choice and great value for money if you have big hands.\n", '\n  I waited a lot longer to get this phone.

I am writing this review after using this machine for quite 2 or 3 months. It is making horrible noise during spin function, you literally have to rush and hold the machine as it's moving so horribly. Please don't buy Samsung products because they don't even bother to solve your issues after calling customer service so many times. The person came and test the machine with 4 clothes even after having 6.5 kg capacity. Then machine did not make noise at that time and they updated the issue as resolved and again same story the other day. Really frustrated with this machine and Samsung service. I have uploaded a video of the spin function making that noise. For reference.\n", '\n  Honest review after 4 months of usage.', 'Pros:', "1. U put clothes, detergent, and plug into tap and forget. It'll do a nice washing.", 'Truly automatic.', '2.wash quality is impressive', '3.powerful moter for rotation.', 'Cons:', '1. A lot of water is required. This is a little drawback, as water is scarce in metroes.', '2. Clothes get tangled more.', '3. Takes a bit more time for the operation.', "Overall it's a nice automatic washing machine. I m 100% satisfied.Wud recommend to buy.\n", '\n  This product IS REALLY NICE and BEAUTIFUL', "I'M GLAD TO BUY THIS PRODUCT", 'ALL THE FEATURES ARE WORKING PROPERLY', 'IT WAS BEST ONE THAN OTHER COMPANIES\n', '\n  After a lot of research I finally purchased Samsung and this product was launched in last year.', 'I ordered this product on 20th June 19 and received the product on 22nd June 19 and availability of Samsung Technician near to my location I got installed on the same day within 4 hours after I received product.', '23rd I washed my clothes.... 6kg..... Perfect wash and stains almost removed.', '24th I washed my blankets and no damage to blankets', '25th I washed my formals light coloured clothes perfect wash with no damage', 'The clothes get 80% dry in normal mode', 'If you choose Normal+Monsoon (additional 15mins) clothes get 90% dry.', 'If you choose Normal +Monsoon (additional 30mins)', 'Clothes get 95%dry.', 'In built child lock (sudden open of lid machine automatically pause)', 'Inbuilt voltage protecter', 'Simple and effective features.', "Perfect for couples and bachelor's\n", "\n  worst product i got damaged product received on 4th of October and while installation he found on issue system rins are not working i was called amazon but they saying it's not our problem it's Samsung problem and i called to Samsung service center and explained my problem but they also saying it's not our problem it's amazon problem from 8th October to still my issue was not fixed please don't believe online products waist worst amazon and Samsung\n", '\n  Worst product.

Looks fabulous, works brilliantly.  I'd done a thorough research before deciding to select this.  At this price, we are getting Convection Microwave (that means grill+convection) from one of the most reputed & purely Indian brand which is which is really great. There are other brands that are selling grill microwave at this price and their convection is much more expensive than this one.", 'And yeah, I also received a starter kit which was a surprise because it was clearly mentioned on the listing that there is no starter kit with this product. :)', 'We also received a free demo from Godrej. The demo guy was very helpful and explained everything quite well. Overall, i would say this was a good investment.  Highly recommended.\n', "\n  Received grey colour instead of white front, but my spouse happy with the colour. Too early to say about the performance. Since she has use LG product before hence this is same, but this is convection hence better options. Demo done by Godrej person Munna yesterday late evening. Very nice behaviour and good knowledge of the product. I knew this guy before also , I don't have to follow up for DEMO. Overall till now my experience is excellent.

Personally we feel for some of the trivial things like rice and dal the pre-programmed time is more than the gas-cooking time which makes us question the use of microwave which is supposed to be efficient and hassle free cooking.', 'So according to us the only drawback is that if one sticks to pre-programmed recipes he/she might end up spending more time than required for gas-cooking.
